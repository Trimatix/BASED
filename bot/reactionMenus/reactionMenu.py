class ReactionMenu(ISerializable):
    """A versatile class implementing emoji reaction menus.
    This class can be used as-is, to create unsaveable reaction menus of any type, with vast possibilities for behaviour.
    ReactionMenu need only be extended in the following cases:
    - When creating a 'preset' class with a new constructor creating a commonly used menu format, such as ReactionRolePicker
    - Your reaction menu should be saveable to file to be reloaded after a bot restart, such as ReactionPollMenu
    - The default getMenuEmbed method is inadequate
    - You require specialized behaviour handled/triggered outside of reactions.
      For example, a menu whose content may be changed via commands.

    How to use this class:
    1. Send a message
    2. (optional) Create a TimedTask that will call a menu deleting function (e.g deleteReactionMenu)
                  and pass your new message ID on expiry
                  TODO: add a constructor flag and TimedTask config data class to ReactionMenu constructor for
                        autoscheduling menu expiry on menu creation
    3. Pass your new message and TimedTask to the ReactionMenu constructor, also specifying a dictionary of menu options
    4. Call updateMessage on your new ReactionMenu instance
    5. Use discord's client events of either on_reaction_add and on_reaction_remove or on_raw_reaction_add and
       on_raw_reaction_remove to call your new menu's reactionAdded and reactionRemoved methods
       (bot.py has this behaviour already)
       TODO: Make reactionAdded and reactionRemoved ignore emoji that are not options in the menu

    The real power of this class can be harnessed by binding function calls to individual menu option reactions when
    creating your options dictionary. A great example of this is in ReactionRolePicker, which actually has no extra
    behaviour added over ReactionMenu. It acts more as a ReactionMenu preset, defining a new constructor which transforms
    a dictionary of emojis to roles into an options dictionary, where each option's addFunc is bound to a role granting
    function, and its removeFunc is bound to a role removing function. The only extra behaviour ReactionRolePickerOption
    implements over ReactionMenuOption is the addition of its associated role ID being saved during serialize.
    
    The options in your options dictionary do not have to be of the same type - each option could have completely
    different behaviour. The only consideration you may need to make when creating such an object is whether or
    not you wish for it to be saveable - in which case, you should extend ReactionMenu into a new module,
    providing a custom serialize method and deserialize function, and then register your class as saveable with
    the @saveableMenu decorator.
